* Urgent
- being able to pass python generators
- more documentation (quite done; not committed)

* Optional
- importing arguments for more callable objects - like ufunc of numpy
- importing python classes, and methods, may be, as subclasses 
  of 'python-object

* For Release 
- review and may be, add tests
