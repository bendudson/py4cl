* Urgent
- communication *numpy-pickle- variables to python process on pystart
- asking user to set up python process on first installation - may
  be, make a 'initialize function
- checking what happens when output is "asynchronous" - say, when
  model.fit of keras is called
- being able to pass python generators
- more documentation (quite done; not committed)

* Optional
- importing arguments for more callable objects - like ufunc of numpy
- importing python classes, and methods, may be, as subclasses 
  of 'python-object

* For Release 
- review and may be, add tests
