* For Release: automate the following?
- pyinterrupt, pycall-monitor, pymethod-monitor: check whether interrupting
  works "as expected", and future commands continue to work; check if 
  monitor works "as expected"
- save-config, load-config, (setf config-var): check if changing the value
  in lisp changes the value in python
- discuss the following: issues-for-chain.lisp tests/does-not-work.lisp, src/chain.lisp
- more testing may be

* Future Work
- importing arguments for more callable objects - like ufunc of numpy
  Further, note that some (only some builtin ones) python functions like "sum"
  do not take keyword args!
- finding equivalent of inspect._empty in python2 (unable to google)
- importing python classes, and methods, may be, as subclasses 
  of 'python-object; to be able to use make-instance and slot-value 
  might require knowledge of MOP, to make python-object at the same level
  as standard-object
- should return value of defpyfun matter - so as to indicate success or failure?
  failure is anyways indicated by errors
- should pycall-monitor and pymethod-monitor completely replace pycall
  and pymethod? if so, what other changes are needed?
- ability to define customized arg-lists, documentation, and calling methods
  for functions: this can serve as a community project to cover up some 
  naming and arg-list idiosyncrasies
- cleaning up documentation while defining functions - many python functions 
  have documentation intended for use directly in md/rst files
