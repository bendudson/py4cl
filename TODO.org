* Urgent
- more documentation (quite done; not committed)

* Optional
- importing arguments for more callable objects - like ufunc of numpy
- finding equivalent of inspect._empty in python2 (unable to google)
- importing python classes, and methods, may be, as subclasses 
  of 'python-object; to be able to use make-instance might require 
  knowledge of MOP
- should return value of defpyfun matter - so as to indicate success or failure?
  failure is anyways indicated by errors
- should pycall-monitor and pymethod-monitor completely replace pycall
  and pymethod? if so, what other changes are needed?
- ability to define customized arg-lists, documentation, and calling methods
  for functions: this can serve as a community project to cover up some 
  naming and arg-list idiosyncrasies
- cleaning up documentation while defining functions - many functions have 
  documentation intended for use directly in md/rst files

* For Release 
- review and may be, add tests
